# Student-Enrollment-Form using JSONPowerDB and NetBeans

Description
This is an HTML form designed for student enrollment, utilizing JsonPowerDB as the underlying database. JsonPowerDB enables the execution of Create, Update, Retrieve, and Delete (CURD) operations on the student data stored within the form.

Benefits of JSONPowerDB
-JsonPowerDB is a user-friendly and intuitive real-time database that is simple to use.
-It allows for easy retrieval of data in a JSON format, eliminating the need for complex backend code.
-Unlike traditional databases, JsonPowerDB does not require explicit schema definition, making it convenient and flexible.
-Querying the database is straightforward, as it does not require knowledge of SQL commands, simplifying the development process.

Release History (release of JsonPowerDB related code on Github): 07/07/2023
